# üß™ Homelab Infrastructure

Welcome to my personal homelab repository! This setup is tailored to my needs, preferences, and environment. 
Everything you‚Äôll find here is built the way I like it ‚Äî opinionated by design.

This repo also documents my **GitOps journey** ‚Äî starting small with Docker and Portainer Git integration, and gradually evolving. The long-term goal is to migrate key services to a Kubernetes cluster managed by **ArgoCD** for high availability and better infrastructure-as-code practices.

I'm always happy to chat, discuss improvements, or hear new ideas. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you have suggestions. That said, just because something works for you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll fit here ‚Äî I may not merge changes that don‚Äôt align with my goals.

You‚Äôre absolutely welcome to fork this repo and make it your own!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- üê≥ **Docker Compose** is used to define each stack, with environment variables stored in `.env` files (see each folder‚Äôs `sample.env`).
- üì¶ **Portainer GitOps** watches the `main` branch and checks for updates **every 60 seconds**, automatically reconciling and redeploying changes.
- üîÅ **Dependabot** checks for updated Docker image and Github Actions versions **daily** and opens a PR with updated tags ‚Äî this works smoothly with Portainer‚Äôs reconciliation loop.
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions handle security scanning and YAML linting.

---

## üöÄ Deployment

All stacks are designed for deployment via **Portainer with Git integration**:

1. Create a Git-backed stack in Portainer.
2. Point it to the appropriate folder in this repository.
3. Copy `sample.env` to `prod.env` in Portainer if needed.
4. Portainer automatically syncs changes from the `main` branch.

---

## üîê Notes

- `prod.env` files are intentionally **not tracked** in this repo.
- Only `sample.env` files are provided for reference.
- Store secrets securely ‚Äî never commit them.

## üìò Service Details

### Home Assistant

Used primarily for small automations ‚Äî motion lighting, device status alerts, etc. It's just getting started, but I plan to expand its capabilities. 
I may soon update the container configuration to enable additional hardware driver mappings for Zigbee, Bluetooth, or USB serial devices.

‚û°Ô∏è [See directory](portainer/home-assistant)

---

### Homepage

My central homelab dashboard. Displays the status of all services, useful bookmarks, and helpful widgets like weather and system status. 
It's the first place I check when accessing the homelab. 

I chose it because the config is a delarative .yaml file which makes sense with my GitOps shift.

### Mediarr

A full media automation and streaming stack:

- **Prowlarr**: Indexer manager ‚Äî centralizes and manages torrent/indexer configs.
- **Sonarr**: Automatically downloads and organizes TV shows.
- **Radarr**: Same as Sonarr, but for movies.
- **Bazarr**: Automatically fetches and manages subtitles for content handled by Sonarr and Radarr.
- **Jellyfin**: Media server for streaming movies and shows locally or remotely.
- **Jellyseerr**: Request interface for Jellyfin, like Overseerr but compatible with Jellyfin.
- **FlareSolverr**: Bypasses anti-bot protection for indexers and search engines (used by Prowlarr).
- **Glutun**: Manages VPN access for apps that need to tunnel traffic (e.g., qBittorrent).
- **qBittorrent**: Torrent client used for media downloads, often routed through VPN via Glutun.

### Monitoring

Currently includes:

- **Prometheus**: Scrapes and stores metrics from my services.
- **Grafana**: Dashboards to visualize metrics and track system health.

Planned additions:
- **Loki**: Log aggregation system for Grafana.
- **OpenTelemetry**: For tracing and advanced observability across services.

### Nginx Proxy Manager

Handles reverse proxying and SSL termination for internal services via Let's Encrypt. Super easy to use with a web UI. 
**Will be replaced with Traefik** soon, since Traefik‚Äôs declarative config makes more sense with my GitOps and declarative config shift.

‚û°Ô∏è [See directory](portainer/npm)

---

### Semaphore

Used to run **Ansible playbooks** through a web UI. I plan to also use it for **OpenTofu (Terraform fork)** to manage and automate provisioning 
and config of my **Proxmox machines** ‚Äî making the entire infrastructure more reproducible and manageable from a single UI.

‚û°Ô∏è [See directory](portainer/semaphore)

---

### Vaultwarden

Self-hosted Bitwarden-compatible password manager. I use this to store all my credentials securely and access them across devices, synced via browser and mobile clients.
